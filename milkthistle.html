		<p><strong> About </strong></p>

		<p> A venue for the discerning drinker. The Milk Thistle is a hidden prohibition cocktail bar in Bristol. </p>
		
		<p> We pride ourselves on being purveyors of the finest cocktails in the city, and with four floors, including a cocktail bar, lounge and private function rooms we’re also the perfect place to host a truly fabulous party!
		</p>

		<p> With a reputation as one of Bristol’s best kept secrets we promise to provide a decadent escape for those in the know who are looking for good food, good drinks,  good company, and most of all, a good time!
