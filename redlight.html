		<p><strong> About </strong></p>

		<p> A great, late-night hidey-hole, and an ideal place to escape the boisterous antics of Park Street.</p>
		
		<p>Red Light advertises its presence on Union Street by, well, a red light, emanating from a graffiti covered doorway. Pick up the payphone, press the button and… presto. Billing itself as a late-night drinking den with an air of 1950s panache, Red Light has a cocktail list that pairs customisable classics with new creations. True to its location, it’s about quality, not crowd-pleasing.</p>

		<p> Some of the drinks had us raising an eyebrow at the flavour, and we did find that Red Light’s short cocktails were far better than their long ones, but die-hard booze fanatics will certainly find something to interest them here.
