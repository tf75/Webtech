		<p><strong> About </strong></p>

		<p>The Canteen-style bar and terrace is next to a Banksy mural with free live music and locally sourced food. </p>
		
		<p>The Canteen opened its doors in August 2009 to serve and provide for the people of Hamilton House, Stokes Croft, Bristol and beyond. At first a caf√©, a bar, a restaurant and a music venue, the Canteen has become a melting pot, a meeting place and a place for people. Born out of the same ethos as Coexist CIC but formed as a separate company, the Canteen has driven the creative resurgence of Stokes Croft and been a centre piece to the Hamilton House story.</p>

		<p>We value inclusivity, accessibility and healthy eating by keeping our prices affordable and always having a vegan and/or vegetarian option on the menu.
